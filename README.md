# Poker night simulator
Solo coding project for fun (*and learning*), still WIP. Once the poker game starts working this Readme will be properly updated with how-to instructions.

**Features to implement for the actual poker:**
- Hand comparisons for 2+ players
- Game sequencing
- Smoother method calls and conversion from card's string to numeric representation (vice-versa)
- Funny graphical displays with some ASCII ANSI escape code
- Betting system!
- User inputs
- Probability calculator for hands

**Features to potentially implement afterward:**
- Simulate 1000+ games to create a dataset, then build agents to play against
- Add parallelization
- Visualize trends from interesting EDA discoveries?
- Push the limits of poker
